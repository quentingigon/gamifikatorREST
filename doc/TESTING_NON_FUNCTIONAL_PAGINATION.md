# Pagination

## Why pagination ?
We paginate to avoid having to download the integrality of the data in the server but instead "chunks" of data in order. That way the time to access the page is greatly reduced when large amount of data are present and the results are displayed more nicely.

It also allows a more coherent way of displaying the results.
